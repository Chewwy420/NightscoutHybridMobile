# Updating your Nightscout for Push Notifications (Optional, but really cool.  You should definitely do this)

Your Nightscout website will generate push notifications and send them to this new mobile app for any events (Highs, Lows, Announcements, etc) that happen.  You can customize which types of notifications you want to receive.  You will, however, need to update your Azure website from this Work In Progress (WIP) branch of the [Nightscout repo](https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor/tree/wip/azurepush).

TODO:  Update this with more detailed instructions once Scott merges his fork into the WIP branch.
